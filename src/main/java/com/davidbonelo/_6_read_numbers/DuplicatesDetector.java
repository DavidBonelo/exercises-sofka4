/*
- ArrayList is faster. Since it is non-synchronized, while vector operations give slower performance since they are synchronized
  (thread-safe), if one thread works on a vector, it has acquired a lock on it, which forces any other thread wanting
  to work on it to have to wait until the lock is released.
- If we donâ€™t know how much data we will have but know the rate at which it grows, Vector has an advantage since we can set the increment value in vectors.
- Most of the time, programmers prefer ArrayList over Vector because ArrayList can be synchronized explicitly using Collections.synchronizedList.
- ArrayList is preferable when there is no specific requirement to use vector.
